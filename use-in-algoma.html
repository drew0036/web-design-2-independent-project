          <h2>Informant Interview Insights</h2>
          <p>Community Readiness - No Awareness or Resistance: Some community members do not feel opioids are an issue or are unaware of the problem while some community members know substance use is an issue across Canada but there is little recognition of the local opioid crisis.</p>
          <p>Community members accessing help have difficulty understanding the clinical language describing the various program treatment and wraparound treatment processes. (i.e., websites, information documents)</p>
          <p>Overdose Risk Awareness: Prescribed, Casual, Recreational, or Experimental substance use related overdose risks are overlooked and are often considered socially acceptable. The dangerously inaccurate historical stereotype “addict” drives the perceived risk related to substance use morbidity and mortality.</p>
          <p>Hours of Operation for services are brief or represent business hours.</p>
          <p>Coordination of care is problematic often leaving gaps in the treatment journey, cause transportation issues (i.e., parking, bus fare, fuel, time), redundant admission processes, lack of services available, requirements to access service (i.e., government id, health card, address).</p>
          <p>Local treatment options are limited, and integral services are unavailable for both youth and adults (i.e., withdrawal treatment, day/evening treatment options, vocational rehabilitation, congruent treatment for concurrent disorders)</p>
          <p>Limited available relevant, timely, measurable local captured data and surveillance information related to mental health and substance use. (i.e., the number of people impacted, waiting for service, who are leaving the community to access services, completing treatment, etc.)</p>
          <p>Inconsistent alert response public advisory notice related to increased overdose frequency.</p>

        <div class="informant-insights-quote div-space">
          <h2>The Social Media Narrative</h2>
          <p>Social media activism can drive misinformation, distort public understanding, and disrupt support.</p>
          <p>The lack of civility can increase polarization.</p>
          <p>Comments can be readily enforced because of the lack of viewpoints and critique of ideas.</p>
          <p>Misinformation can be easily shared to generate a large audience further escalating discrimination and stigma around substance use.</p>

          <p>"I can’t work - I am currently on Ontario Works and waiting for Approval to move to Disability. Wouldn’t it be cheaper and easier to build a treatment centre?"</p>
          <p>"Every time you go to the hospital you pay $6 for parking, or you take 2 buses there and back."</p>
          <p>"I don’t function on business hours but these places that supposed to help are open a couple of hours per week which is not helping."</p>
          <p>"I like to go to the Neighbourhood Resource Centre - There’s always someone there to help, doctors, I can even get haircuts there."</p>

          <p>"Why do I have to wait more than 2 months for treatment and how I am going to get there."</p>
          <p>"I was so frustrated - I looked on the SAH website, and it says withdrawal, crisis, and looks like there is help there but the detox centre is a house on Queen Street with 2 floors, no medical staff to support withdrawal. They told me if I was brought to the detox centre, they wouldn’t be able to assist me."</p>
          <p>"My withdrawals from heroin are so awful, I have done things I never thought I would ever do just to get money to buy more."</p>
          <p>"It’d be nice to use clean needles but it’s not worth the bus rides."</p>
